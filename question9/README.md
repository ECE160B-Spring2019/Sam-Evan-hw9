## Question 9

(Eckel, 8.20) Create a class called MyString which contains a string and has a constructor that initializes the string, and a print() function. Modify StringStack.cpp so that the container holds MyString objects, and main() so it prints them.

Compile Steps:
g++ q9.cpp
Output:
string = deep chocolate fudge
string = rocky road
string = lemon swirl
string = raspberry sorbet
string = wild mountain blackberry
string = jamocha almond fudge
string = fudge ripple
string = pralines & cream
