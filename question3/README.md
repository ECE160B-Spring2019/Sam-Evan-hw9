## Question 3

(Eckel, 5.12) Place objects of the Hen class from question 1 in a Stack. Fetch them out and print them (if you have not already done so, you will need to add Hen::print() to print out the info stored in the Hen class (e.g. the Hen's name)).

Compile Steps:

gcc henStack.cpp <br>
./a.exe <br>

Output:

name of hen: Billy      size of nest: 2   age of egg: 1 <br>
name of hen: Bob        size of nest: 5   age of egg: 3 <br>
name of hen: Borris     size of nest: 6   age of egg: 5 <br>
